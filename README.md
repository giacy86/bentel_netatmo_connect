# Bentel Netatmo Connect
*Automation of Netatmo thermostat mode (away/schedule) based on a GPIO input of a Raspberry PI*
## Introduction
This project was born because the [Netatmo smart thermostat](https://www.netatmo.com/it-it/smart-thermostat) does not have any sort of geofencing functions in the mobile app and therefore you must remember to manually set the absent mode so as not to waste energy unnecessarily.
